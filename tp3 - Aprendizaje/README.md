### Problem: Shopping Behavior Analysis

#### Principle

The objective of this assignment is to create a predictive model that classifies shopping behavior, determining the likelihood of a user making a purchase based on various features.

#### How to solve the problem

#Initialization:
- Loading the shopping dataset containing user sessions with various features.
- Splitting the dataset into evidence (features) and labels (purchase or no-purchase indications).

#### Model Training:

Using a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier to train the model. 
The KNN model learns patterns in the evidence data to predict whether a user will make a purchase.

#### Evaluation:

Assessing the model's performance by calculating Sensitivity (True Positive Rate) and Specificity (True Negative Rate) to measure how well it predicts purchases and non-purchases.

#### Interpretation of Results:

Analyzing the model's ability to predict user behavior based on its sensitivity and specificity metrics.
    
#### What is needed ?

:warning: Ensure you have Python 3.10 or higher installed.

:warning: You'll need scikit-learn library.

To install the library, execute the following command:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn
```
To run the model, execute the following command:

```bash
python3 shopping.py shopping.csv
```

#### Conclusion

The AI-powered predictive model demonstrates the capability to predict user purchase behavior based on available features.
However, as in many machine learning scenarios, there might be instances where the model's predictions are not always accurate, leading to potential misclassifications.
The results suggest that the model is better at identifying users who did not make a purchase (high specificity) compared to identifying users who did make a purchase (sensitivity).
