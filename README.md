## Repository for my artificial intelligence course at IUA - Ewan TALEC
This repository's purpose is to display the result of the practical experiences of the Artificial Intelligence course, taught at the (IUA) in the second semester of 2023.

### Structure:
The repository is structured as follows:
> Each folder contains a `README.md` file containing the instructions for each practical.
- `tp1-agentes-resolucion-problemas/`: This practical consists of implementing a problem resolution agent.
- 
- `tp2-conocimiento-incertidumbre/`: This practical consists of implementing a knowledge and uncertainty agent. **Not implemented yet.**

- `tp3-aprendizaje/`: This practical consists of implementing a learning agent.
:construction: **Not implemented yet.**

- `tp4-optimizacion-aplicaciones/`: This practical consists of the implementation of an optimization agent.
